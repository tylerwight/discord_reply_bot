Just replies "Nice." in chat any time it sees '69'


## How to use:

* Find some guides on creating a bot on discords servers and get the bots token.
* Create a .env file in the same directory as the script and put your token in so it looks like this but with your token:
```
DISCORD_TOKEN=kjawe;tlkjnaw;etn;anwet
```
* run the bot 

```
python3 sixty_nice.py
```
