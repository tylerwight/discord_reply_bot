Just replies with a string of your choice any time it sees a specific message


## How to use:

* Find some guides on creating a bot on discords servers and get the bots token.
* Create a .env file in the same directory as the script and put your token in so it looks like this but with your token:
```
DISCORD_TOKEN=kjawe;t<blahblah>lkjnaw;etn;anwet
```
* run the bot 

```
python3 discord_reply_bot.py
```
